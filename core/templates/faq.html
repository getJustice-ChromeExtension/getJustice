      <br>
      <h4> Who are reports sent to?</h4>
      <p class="vision"> Reports are sent to various civil rights organizations based on the type
      of crime that is selected. These organizations include but are not limited to the NAACP, ACLU and 
      the Southern Coalition for Social Justice. You also have the option to search for your state and federal
      representatives on our "Know Your Reps" page and include the email address of your representatives
      so they also receive your report. 
      </p>
      <br>

      <h4> Can I remain anonymous?</h4>
      <p> Yes, there is an option to remain anonymous. </p>
      <br>
      <h4> What is the purpose of getJustice?</h4>
      <p class="vision"> The purpose of getJustice is to increase police accountability, 
      decrease the length of time it takes for an instance of injustice 
      to be seen on social media before a suspect is charged with a crime, 
      and foster a new generation of political activists by providing millenials
      with easy access to activate their political power. </p>
      <br>
      <h4> If I send a report will I get a response?</h4>
      <p class="vision"> There is a chance that you will receive a response but we can make no
      guarantees. Those factors depend on how the organizations you send your reports to 
      handle responses and whether you provide a reply-to email.
