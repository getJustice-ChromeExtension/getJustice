                  <p class="vision">Our goal is to increase police accountability, decrease the length of time it takes between an instance of injustice being seen on social media and a suspect is charged with a crime, and foster a new generation of political activists by providing millenials with easy access to activate their political power. We wish to bring pressure by collective action on the police and other authorities to respond quickly and act proactively to end such instances of injustice.</p>
